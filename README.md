## Development

This project is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) SDK 53, using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) 0.79 and [Supabase](https://supabase.io) as the backend. The app features:

- **File-based routing** powered by Expo Router 5.
- **Authentication** and real-time database operations via Supabase.
- **Cross-platform compatibility** for Android, iOS, and Web.
- **New Architecture** enabled by default for better performance.
- **React 19** for improved rendering and hooks.

### Technical Specifications

- **Expo SDK**: 53.0.0
- **React**: 19.0.0
- **React Native**: 0.79.2
- **Node.js**: 20.x recommended (18.x minimum)
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Node.js standard library modules (like "stream" or "events"), the project includes a custom Metro configuration to resolve these compatibility issues. The configuration is in `metro.config.js` and disables the package exports feature that can cause problems with certain libraries.

### Reset the Project

To reset and start fresh:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This will move the starter code to the `app-example` directory and create a blank `app` directory for development.
